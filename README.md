[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/avivace/ror2server?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/avivace/ror2server)

Host your Risk of Rain 2 dedicated server anywhere using Docker. Powered by Wine and the X virtual framebuffer to seamlessy run on Linux machines.

[Guide on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2077564253).


## Quickstart

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. On Debian systems, you can use the [bootstrap_debian.sh](https://github.com/avivace/ror2-server/blob/master/boostrap_debian.sh) script to set up Docker and some other dependencies.

Run the Docker container with:

```bash
docker run -p 27015:27015/udp avivace/ror2server:latest
```

Players need to start Risk of Rain 2, open the console pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd> and insert this command:

```
connect "<SERVER_IP>:27015";
```

Replace `SERVER_IP` with the public IP of the server running the Docker Image.

By default, the server has no password and runs on UDP port 27015. 

## Customize configuration

If you want to start the server on port **25000** with password **hello**:

```
docker run -p 25000:25000/udp -e R2_SV_PORT=25000 -e R2_PSW='hello' avivace/ror2server:latest
```

Players will then join with:

```
cl_password "hello"; connect "<SERVER_IP>:25000";
```

You can pass these additional environment variables to customise your server configuration:

- `R2_PLAYERS`, the maximum number of players, default is 4;
- `R2_HEARTBEAT`, set to `1` to **advertise to the master server and list your server** in the internal server browser. If you enable this, add `-p 27016:27016/udp` to your Docker command;
- `R2_HOSTNAME`, the name that will appear in the server browser;
- `R2_PSW`, the password someone must provide to join this server;
- `R2_ENABLE_MODS`, set to `1` to enable mod support (given you mounted the mod folders as described [below](#mod-support));
- `R2_QUERY_PORT`, the listen port for the Steamworks connection, needed to list the server in the game browser on a alternate port, you need to add `-p <PORT>:<PORT>/udp` to your Docker command;
- `R2_SV_PORT`, the listen port for the game server, needed to list the server in the game browser on a alternate port, you also need to add `-p <PORT>:<PORT>/udp` to your Docker command.
- `R2_TAGS`, the tags the server will have in the server browser.

You shouldn't need to change `R2_QUERY_PORT` and `R2_SV_PORT` if you are not planning on hosting more server instances on the same machine/IP.

Append one or more `-e VARIABLENAME=VALUE` to your Docker command to set environment variables.

To check if your server is correctly getting announced to the Steamworks network, you can use this API call:

```bash
curl http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetServersAtAddress/v0001/?format=json&addr=<IP_ADDRESS>
```

## Mod support

To install and enable mods server side, you'll need a directory containing:

- The **BepInEx** folder with the desired mods;
- The `doorstop_config.ini` and `winhttp.dll` files, both shipped with the BepInEx version you intend to use.

Supposing your mod directory is in `/path/to/directory`, you can start your server as follows:

```bash
docker run -p 27015:27015/udp -v /path/to/directory:/home/steam/ror2-dedicated/mods -e R2_ENABLE_MODS=1 avivace/ror2server:latest
```

Beware that some mods requires the client to also have them installed.

## FAQ

##### Can I run this on a VPS?

Yes, any Linux box works. For decent performance, you need 3 GB of free space and at least 2 GB of RAM.


##### Server is stuck at "Unloading unused Assets"

That line is usually the last one of the initialization process. It usually means your server is working correctly, that is not a blocking error. If you can't connect to your server at that point, it's probably a network issue.


##### Server is stuck at "Could not load config ..."

If you see something like this:

```
Could not load config /Config/server_pregame.cfg: Could not find file "Z:\home\steam\ror2-dedicated\Risk of Rain 2_Data\Config\server_pregame.cfg"
```

Be aware that these kind of warning messages are non blocking, they are just warnings and the server initialization will proceed as normal.
